👋🏽 I'm Owais, a software engineer, writer, and artist from Austin, TX.
I love to tinker, learn and create. Most recently I was a senior backend dev
at [Edlink](https://ed.link/). I'm currently looking for my next role! Feel
to shoot me a [message](#contact-me) if you're interested in working together
or would like a copy of my resume.

## Projects

All of my projects are hosted on [github](https://github.com/desertthunder)

Right now I'm focusing primarily on [`js_parser`](https://github.com/desertthunder),
a tool to create an abstract syntax tree from JavaScript source code. In my journey
into the world of OCaml and function programming, I discovered the wonderful Gleam
community and have begun trying to add to their great ecosystem. You can read the
friendly [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/js_parser) here if you're interested.
